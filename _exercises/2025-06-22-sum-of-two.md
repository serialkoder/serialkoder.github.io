title: "Find Two Numbers with a Given Sum"
tags: [algorithms, two-pointer]
hints:
  - "Sort the array first."
  - "Use one pointer at each end and move inward based on the sum."
answer: |
  After sorting, initialise `i = 0`, `j = n−1`.  
  While `i < j`:
  * if `a[i] + a[j] == target` → done  
  * else move the lower/higher pointer inward.  
  Overall O(n log n) due to sort (or O(n) if the array is pre-sorted).

Given an unsorted array of integers and a target value, find **any** pair that adds up to the target.  
Return the two indices or report that no such pair exists.
