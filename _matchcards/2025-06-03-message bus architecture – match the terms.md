pairs:
  - left: "Message Bus"
    right: "Intermediary that routes messages between producers and consumers to decouple services"
  - left: "Channel / Topic"
    right: "Named logical queue or stream that groups related messages"
  - left: "Message Envelope"
    right: "Metadata wrapper around a payload containing IDs, headers, timestamps, etc."
  - left: "Publisher (Producer)"
    right: "Component that sends messages into the bus without targeting a specific consumer"
  - left: "Handler (Consumer)"
    right: "Component that receives messages from the bus and processes them"
  - left: "Command"
    right: "Imperative message intended for exactly one handler to perform an action"
  - left: "Event"
    right: "Notification describing something that already happened, broadcast to zero or many subscribers"
  - left: "At-Most-Once Delivery"
    right: "Messages may be lost but are never redelivered (0 – 1 times)"
  - left: "At-Least-Once Delivery"
    right: "Messages are retried until acknowledged, so they reach consumers one or more times"
  - left: "Exactly-Once Delivery"
    right: "System ensures each message’s effects happen no more and no less than one time"
  - left: "Ordering Guarantee"
    right: "Assurance that messages with the same key arrive in the sequence they were sent"
  - left: "Idempotency"
    right: "Ability to process duplicate messages without altering the final state"
  - left: "Retry with Exponential Backoff"
    right: "Automatic reprocessing of failed messages after progressively longer delays"
  - left: "Dead-Letter Queue"
    right: "Holding area for messages that exceeded retry limits or cannot be processed"
  - left: "Saga Pattern"
    right: "Sequence of local transactions across services coordinated by messages with compensations on failure"
  - left: "Choreography Saga"
    right: "Saga variant where each service reacts to events and publishes the next event—no central coordinator"
  - left: "Orchestration Saga"
    right: "Saga variant managed by a central orchestrator that sends commands and awaits replies"
  - left: "Transactional Outbox"
    right: "Pattern that stores outbound messages in the same DB transaction then later publishes them"
  - left: "Schema Registry"
    right: "Central service that stores message schemas and enforces compatibility rules as they evolve"
  - left: "Back-Pressure"
    right: "Mechanism that slows publishers when consumers or the bus are overloaded"
