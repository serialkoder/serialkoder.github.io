tags: [productivity]
intro: |
  One deck to rule the day.  
  Flip through every morning (≈ 2‑3 min) to lock in the habits, heuristics,
  and engineering principles that keep momentum high even when workload spikes.
cards:
  # ‣ Morning anchors
  - q: "What’s the very first action each morning?"
    a: "Wake up → freshen up (no phone scrolling)."
  - q: "Minimum nightly sleep + target lights‑out time?"
    a: "7 hours; in bed by 23:00."
  - q: "Daily calorie‑burn goal & workout slot?"
    a: "400 – 800 kcal via exercise between 20:00 – 22:00."
  - q: "Lifelong health principle?"
    a: "Relentlessly pursue being *younger & healthier* through exercise, nutrition, and anti‑aging habits."
  - q: "Instant discipline reset that worked before?"
    a: "Dopamine detox — especially ditching YouTube Shorts."

  # ‣ Engineering focus
  - q: "Three study pillars to revisit daily?"
    a: "Software Architecture, System Design, Data Structures & Algorithms."
  - q: "Why lean on LLMs for routine code and double‑down on deep work?"
    a: |
      LLMs handle boilerplate; real differentiation comes from problem‑solving,
      trade‑off analysis, and elegant architecture.
  - q: "First step before starting **any** project or task?"
    a: "Write an end‑to‑end context doc."
  - q: "Preferred tool combo for development & writing?"
    a: "**cline** for deep dives + IntelliJ for coding; refine docs with Claude."
  - q: "Core mindset during work hours?"
    a: "Hyper‑focus on execution; eliminate wasted motion."

  # ‣ Execution & impact
  - q: "Guiding question when choosing projects?"
    a: "“What impact can I extract from this?”"
  - q: "How do deliverables relate to metrics?"
    a: "Ship great deliverables and metrics follow — just keep an eye on them."
  - q: "Where is the single source of truth for backlog?"
    a: "Asana — review both personal & work boards regularly."
  - q: "What four fields belong in every micro‑retro after solving a problem?"
    a: "Context · Approach · Outcome · Lessons."
  - q: "Why capture those retros?"
    a: "Creates a searchable knowledge base so future you (or an AI) can reuse the insight instead of relearning."

  # ‣ Mental freshness
  - q: "Best quick brain‑boosters when bored?"
    a: "Solve chess puzzles, knock out an easy Codeforces problem, or dive into a classic video game for a short burst."
