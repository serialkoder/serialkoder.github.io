title: "Thinking Frameworks Field Guide"
intro: |
  A quick‑hit deck covering key ideas from **“Thinking Frameworks: An Exhaustive Field Guide.”**
  Click a question to reveal the answer and sharpen your toolkit.
cards:
  - q: "What are the five broad categories of thinking frameworks highlighted in the guide?"
    a: |
      1. Analytical / Root‑Cause  
      2. Systems & Scientific  
      3. Strategic / Decision  
      4. Creative / Innovation  
      5. Personal Effectiveness
  - q: "What core advantage comes from expanding your ‘thinking framework’ toolbox?"
    a: "It lets you re‑frame problems, surface fresh insights, and craft smarter solutions faster—avoiding the blind spots of default thinking."
  - q: "Define First‑Principles thinking in one sentence."
    a: "Reducing a problem to its basic truths and rebuilding the solution from the ground up."
  - q: "When is First‑Principles thinking especially powerful?"
    a: "When tackling a seemingly impossible problem or challenging a high‑cost industry assumption."
  - q: "Outline the three key steps of First‑Principles reasoning."
    a: |
      1. Identify fundamental facts.  
      2. Challenge every assumption.  
      3. Re‑assemble a solution from those fundamentals.
  - q: "What is the main watch‑out when using First‑Principles thinking?"
    a: "It can be time‑consuming and may ignore valuable prior knowledge if taken to extremes."
  - q: "Describe the 5 Whys technique."
    a: "Ask “Why did this happen?” repeatedly (≈5 times) until the root cause emerges."
  - q: "Name one pitfall of the 5 Whys approach."
    a: "Stopping at symptoms or overlooking multiple interacting root causes."
  - q: "State the Pareto (80/20) principle in the context of problem solving."
    a: "Roughly 80 % of effects stem from about 20 % of causes, so focus on the vital few."
  - q: "How do you apply Pareto analysis in practice?"
    a: "List causes, quantify their impact, rank them, and address the small set producing the majority of the effect."
  - q: "Which automaker popularized repeated “why” questioning to raise assembly‑line quality?"
    a: "Toyota, under Taiichi Ohno’s leadership."
  - q: "Give a concise definition of Systems Thinking."
    a: "An approach that analyzes the whole system—parts, relationships, feedback loops—to foresee ripple effects."
  - q: "List three steps for applying Systems Thinking."
    a: |
      • Map elements and relationships.  
      • Identify feedback loops and delays.  
      • Spot leverage points for high‑impact interventions.
  - q: "What is a common boundary‑setting challenge in Systems Thinking?"
    a: "Too narrow misses key factors; too broad becomes unmanageable."
  - q: "Summarize the Hypothetico‑Deductive Method."
    a: "Form a hypothesis, deduce predictions, run tests, and refine or reject based on results."
  - q: "How do you guard against confirmation bias in scientific reasoning?"
    a: "Design tests aimed at disproving the hypothesis, not just confirming it."
  - q: "Expand the acronym OODA."
    a: "Observe → Orient → Decide → Act."
  - q: "In what scenarios is the OODA Loop most valuable?"
    a: "Fast‑changing, high‑stakes situations where rapid adaptation beats perfect analysis."
  - q: "What are the four stages of PDCA?"
    a: "Plan, Do, Check, Act."
  - q: "Which PDCA stage is most often skipped—and why is that risky?"
    a: "‘Check’; without verifying results, you may scale a change that doesn’t actually work."
  - q: "What is the purpose of a SWOT analysis?"
    a: "To surface internal Strengths & Weaknesses and external Opportunities & Threats for strategic planning."
  - q: "Porter’s Five Forces looks at which external pressures?"
    a: "Competitive rivalry, threat of new entrants, threat of substitutes, supplier power, and buyer power."
  - q: "List the five stages of Design Thinking."
    a: "Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test."
  - q: "Why is skipping the Empathize stage in Design Thinking dangerous?"
    a: "You risk solving the wrong problem because you haven’t understood real user needs."
  - q: "What does the SCAMPER acronym stand for?"
    a: |
      Substitute • Combine • Adapt • Modify (or Magnify) • Put to other uses • Eliminate • Reverse
  - q: "Which SCAMPER‑style move helped Netflix topple Blockbuster?"
    a: "Eliminating late fees and mailing DVDs instead of requiring in‑store returns."
  - q: "Name the four quadrants of the Eisenhower Matrix."
    a: |
      1. Urgent & Important  
      2. Important, Not Urgent  
      3. Urgent, Not Important  
      4. Neither Urgent nor Important
  - q: "According to the Eisenhower Matrix, what should you do with tasks that are Important but Not Urgent?"
    a: "Schedule them proactively before they become emergencies."
  - q: "Outline the core workflow of Getting Things Done (GTD)."
    a: |
      Capture → Clarify next action → Organize into trusted lists/calendar → Review regularly → Execute by context & priority.
  - q: "Why is consistency critical in GTD?"
    a: "The system only works if you capture and review everything every time—gaps break trust."
  - q: "Define Spaced Repetition in one line."
    a: "A memory technique that reviews material at expanding intervals to cement long‑term recall."
  - q: "How are review intervals adjusted in Spaced Repetition?"
    a: "If you remember well, the next review is spaced farther out; if you forget, the interval shortens and restarts."
  - q: "How do you pick a framework based on problem type?"
    a: "Fuzzy/complex → analytical or systems lens; clear choice → decision tool; need fresh ideas → creative framework."
  - q: "Describe one way to layer frameworks for deeper problem solving."
    a: "Find a root cause with 5 Whys, then generate solutions with Design Thinking."
  - q: "What two practical factors should influence framework selection besides fit?"
    a: "Time constraints and team buy‑in—simple tools people will use beat perfect tools they won’t."
  - q: "What call‑to‑action closes the guide?"
    a: "Try at least two new frameworks on real problems in the next week to avoid slipping back into autopilot."
