title: "Thinking Frameworks – Rapid-Recall Deck"
intro: |
  Five go-to reasoning tools. Flip each card to refresh *when* and *why* to deploy it.
cards:
  - q: "Feynman Technique – core purpose?"
    a: "Expose gaps in understanding by explaining the idea in simple language without notes."
  - q: "Feynman – trigger cue?"
    a: "You or the team feels **fuzzy** on how something really works."
  - q: "First-Principles Decomposition – one-liner?"
    a: "Strip the problem to physics/math/business invariants, then rebuild solutions from those non-negotiables."
  - q: "Decision Tree / Causal Diagram – ideal use case?"
    a: "Choosing among multiple options **or** tracing root causes in a complex system."
  - q: "Analogical (Structure) Mapping – why reach for it?"
    a: "When stuck, import a proven structure from another domain to spark novel designs."
  - q: "Socratic Questioning – key benefit?"
    a: "Surfaces hidden assumptions and prompts evidence-based thinking without antagonism."
  - q: "Framework-selection mantra?"
    a: |
       • **Fuzzy?** → Feynman  
       • **Constrained by reality?** → First Principles  
       • **Too many branches or failures?** → Decision/Causal  
       • **Stalled creativity?** → Analogical  
       • **Groupthink or unclear premises?** → Socratic
