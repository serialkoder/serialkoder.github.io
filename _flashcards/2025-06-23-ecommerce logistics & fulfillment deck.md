  Key logistics concepts every eCommerce architect should know — click each question to reveal the answer.
cards:
  - q: "Drop Shipping"
    a: |
       A retail fulfillment method where the seller **does not hold inventory**; instead, when an order is placed, it is forwarded to a third‑party supplier that ships the product **directly to the customer**, letting the seller act as a demand‑generation layer.

  - q: "Hub‑and‑Spoke Model"
    a: |
       A distribution topology that uses a **central hub warehouse** for bulk storage and multiple **spoke facilities** for regional consolidation. Goods flow *inward* to the hub and *outward* to spokes, lowering inventory duplication while shortening delivery distance to customers.

  - q: "Lead Time"
    a: |
       The **total elapsed time** between the moment a purchase order is created and the moment the goods are available for use or sale. It combines supplier production time, transit time, receiving, and put‑away.

  - q: "Freight Forwarding"
    a: |
       A service that **orchestrates international or domestic cargo movements** on behalf of shippers—booking carriers, consolidating shipments, managing paperwork, customs clearance, and insurance—without owning the transport assets themselves.

  - q: "Reverse Logistics"
    a: |
       The set of processes for **moving products backward in the supply chain** (returns, repairs, recycling, or disposal) to recover value or ensure proper end‑of‑life handling while maintaining customer satisfaction.

  - q: "Route Optimization"
    a: |
       The use of algorithms and real‑time data to **generate the most efficient sequence of stops** for delivery vehicles, minimizing distance, cost, and time while respecting constraints such as time windows, vehicle capacity, and traffic.

  - q: "Fulfillment Center"
    a: |
       A warehouse designed for **picking, packing, and shipping online orders** at high velocity. It holds active inventory close to demand, integrates with order‑management systems, and often provides value‑adds like kitting, personalization, or same‑day cutoff times.

  - q: "Sortation Center"
    a: |
       A node focused on **re‑sorting pre‑packed parcels** by destination ZIP/postcode. It receives consolidated outbound loads, scans and groups parcels onto downstream line‑haul or final‑mile carrier routes, speeding regional delivery without storing inventory.

  - q: "Last‑Mile Delivery"
    a: |
       The **final hand‑off step** that moves a parcel from the closest fulfillment or sortation node **to the customer’s doorstep**. It is typically the most expensive and complex mile due to dispersed endpoints and high service expectations.

  - q: "Inbound Transport"
    a: |
       The flow of raw materials or finished goods **into a facility** (e.g., port → fulfillment center) covering supplier pickup, import clearance, and receiving appointments.

  - q: "Inbound Transport vs Outbound Transport — Key Differences"
    a: |
       • **Direction** – Inbound brings goods *into* inventory; outbound moves orders *out* to customers.  
       • **Stakeholders** – Inbound is supplier‑driven; outbound is customer‑driven.  
       • **Service Level** – Inbound targets replenishment efficiency; outbound targets delivery promise (speed & accuracy).  
       • **Cost Drivers** – Inbound costs hinge on bulk freight and inventory turns; outbound on parcel size, distance, and last‑mile complexity.  
       • **Data Focus** – Inbound forecasts demand and safety stock; outbound tracks order status and customer experience.

  - q: "Last‑Mile Carrier"
    a: |
       A specialized logistics provider (e.g., USPS, UPS, FedEx, bike couriers) that **executes the final delivery leg**, leveraging dense local networks and doorstep service capabilities.

  - q: "Distribution Hub"
    a: |
       A strategically located facility that **receives bulk inbound freight, breaks it down, and re‑dispatches** mixed loads to regional nodes or large retail outlets, balancing inventory and transportation efficiency.

  - q: "Cross‑Docking"
    a: |
       A practice where **inbound trailers are unloaded and matched immediately with outbound trailers** without long‑term storage, reducing handling, dwell time, and inventory holding costs.

  - q: "Order Picking"
    a: |
       The warehouse operation of **retrieving specific SKUs and quantities** from storage locations to assemble a customer order. Accuracy and pick path efficiency directly impact fulfillment speed and labor cost.

  - q: "Parcel Manifest"
    a: |
       A **digital or printed list** detailing every parcel in a shipment: tracking ID, weight, dimensions, declared value, and destination. The manifest is transmitted to carriers for billing, handover verification, and regulatory compliance.

  - q: "Inventory Management"
    a: |
       The discipline of **planning, ordering, storing, and tracking stock** to balance service level with carrying cost. It leverages forecasting, reorder points, safety stock, and real‑time visibility across channels.

  - q: "Outbound Transport"
    a: |
       The movement of **completed customer orders away from a facility**—from parcel sortation through line‑haul to last‑mile carriers—aimed at meeting promised delivery dates and customer experience targets.
